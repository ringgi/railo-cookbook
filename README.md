Railo Cookbook
=================

This cookbook installs Railo onto an OpsWorks Java layer.

### Platforms
- Amazon OpsWorks Java layer

### Cookbooks
- java
- tomcat

And the dependencies of the java and tomcat cookbooks

Attributes
----------
* `node['railo']['app_server']` Type of web application server (currently only tomcat)
* `node['railo']['user']['id']` User name
* `node['railo']['major_version']` Major version of Railo, default `4`
* `node['railo']['minor_version']` Minor version of Railo, default `1`

* `node['railo']['base_installation_directory']` Root directory where the /railo/lib directories will be installed, default `/opt`
* `node['railo']['config_dir']` Full path to the railo configuration directory where the /server and /web directories will be created by Railo, default `/var/lib/railo/config`

Usage
-----
Just include `recipe[railo]` in your node's `run_list` and configure the java and tomcat cookbooks:

```json
{
    "name": "railo-server",
    "description": "A Railo server based on Tomcat",
    "json_class": "Chef::Role",
    "default_attributes": {
        "java": {
            "jdk_version": "7"
        },
        "tomcat": {
            "base_version": "7",
            "deploy_manager_apps": false
        },
        "railo": {
            "major_version": "4",
            "minor_version": "2"
        }
    },
    "override_attributes": {
    },
    "chef_type": "role",
    "run_list": [
        "recipe[railo]"
    ]
}
```

Running the tests
-----------------

A ruby environment with Bundler installed is a prerequisite for using
the testing harness shipped with this cookbook. At the time of this
writing, it works with Ruby 2.0 and Bundler 1.5.3. All programs
involved, with the exception of Vagrant, can be installed by cd'ing
into the parent directory of this cookbook and running "bundle install"

The Rakefile currently ships with an integration test task. Integration tests can also be ran with Test Kitchen
cloud drivers.

Integration tests can be performed on a local workstation using
Virtualbox or VMWare. Detailed instructions for setting this up can be
found at the [Bento](https://github.com/opscode/bento) project web site.

Integration tests using Vagrant can be performed with either
```
bundle exec kitchen test
```
or
```
rake integration:vagrant
```
